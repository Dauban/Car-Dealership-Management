Car Dealership Management System

Overview

This Car Dealership Management System is an advanced software application developed in Java, leveraging object-oriented programming principles to facilitate the management of vehicular sales and personnel oversight within a dealership environment. The system integrates structured file handling techniques to enable persistent data storage and retrieval, ensuring a seamless operational workflow.

Features

Comprehensive Employee Management â€“ Implements structured data organization for employee records, enabling sorting by performance metrics (e.g., number of sales completed).

Vehicle Inventory Control â€“ Maintains a dynamically updated list of available and sold vehicles.

Transaction Processing â€“ Facilitates car sales through an integrated mechanism that associates transactions with specific employees.

Dynamic Data Persistence â€“ Utilizes file-based storage mechanisms to maintain dealership records across multiple sessions.

Menu-Driven Interface â€“ Employs an intuitive, structured user interface for efficient data navigation and operational execution.

Technologies Used

Java â€“ Applied object-oriented programming methodologies to create a modular, scalable system architecture.

File I/O Operations â€“ Implements Files API for robust data persistence and retrieval.

Data Structures & Sorting Algorithms â€“ Utilizes ArrayList for dynamic data handling and implements a sorting mechanism using the Comparable interface.

Enumerations â€“ Leverages enum to enhance code readability and facilitate structured menu-driven functionality.
